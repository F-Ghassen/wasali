# Wasali — User Flows

_Last updated: 2026-03-18_

---

## Overview

Wasali has two user roles. Each role has its own tab bar and flow set.

| Role | Entry point | Core action |
|---|---|---|
| **Sender** | `/(tabs)/index` | Find a driver, book a shipment |
| **Driver** | `/(driver-tabs)/index` | Create a route, manage bookings |

Role is set at sign-up and stored in `profiles.role`. The root `index.tsx` reads the profile and redirects accordingly.

## 5. Booking Status State Machine

```
          ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
pending ──▶  confirmed ──▶ in_transit ──▶ delivered ──▶ [rated]  │
   │            │                                     │          │
   │            └──▶ cancelled                        └──▶ disputed
   └──▶ cancelled
```

| Status | Who transitions | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | System | Booking created |
| `confirmed` | Driver | Taps "Confirm" |
| `in_transit` | Driver | Taps "Mark Collected" |
| `delivered` | Driver | Taps "Mark Delivered" |

---

## 6. Notifications

Push notifications (via `lib/notifications.ts`) + email (Resend) + in-app (notifications table):

| Event | Recipient | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| New booking on route | Driver | push + in-app |
| Booking confirmed | Sender | push + email + in-app |
| Package collected / in transit | Sender | push + email + in-app |
| Package delivered | Sender | push + email + in-app |
| New offer on shipping request | Sender | push + in-app |
| Offer accepted | Driver | push + in-app |
| New P2P carry offer | Document sender | push + in-app |

**Notification delivery pipeline** (`notify-booking-event` Edge Function):
- Triggered by Supabase DB Webhook on `bookings` UPDATE
- Fetches route + recipient profile
- Sends Expo push (native), Resend email (web / notification_email set), inserts notifications row
- `notificationStore` subscribes via Supabase Realtime to receive live inserts

**In-app notification inbox:**
- Profile tab gets a red dot badge when `unreadCount > 0`
- Tapping "Notifications" row opens `NotificationList` bottom sheet
- Tap a notification → navigate to booking + mark read

**QR-assisted collection (driver):**
- When booking is `confirmed`, driver can scan sender's QR code OR tap "Mark as In Transit"
- QR value must equal the booking UUID; mismatch shows error toast
- On successful scan, confirmation alert → `markInTransit()`

**Route performance analytics:**
- Route detail shows: expected gross, actual gross, fill rate bar, delivered count
- Driver dashboard shows 6-month revenue bar chart (`RevenueChart` component)
